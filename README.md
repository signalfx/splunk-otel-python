# Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Python

The Splunk distribution of [OpenTelemetry Python](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python) provides
multiple installable packages that automatically instrument your Python application to capture and report distributed
traces to Splunk APM. Instrumentation works by patching supported libraries at runtime with an OpenTelemetry-compatible
tracer to capture and export trace spans.

This distribution comes with the following defaults:

- [OTLP gRPC exporter](https://opentelemetry-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/exporter/otlp/otlp.html)
  configured to send spans to a locally running
  [Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector)
  (`http://localhost:4317`).
- Unlimited default limits for 
  [configuration options](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/get-data-in/application/python/configuration/advanced-python-otel-configuration.html)
  to support full-fidelity traces.
- Inclusion of [system metrics](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib/tree/main/instrumentation/opentelemetry-instrumentation-system-metrics)

## Requirements

This Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry requires Python 3.8 or later. Supported
libraries are listed
[here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib/tree/main/instrumentation).
