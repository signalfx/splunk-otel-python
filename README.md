The Splunk distribution of [OpenTelemetry
Python](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python) provides
multiple installable packages that automatically instruments your Python
application to capture and report distributed traces to Splunk APM.

This Splunk distribution comes with the following defaults:

- [B3 context propagation](https://github.com/openzipkin/b3-propagation).
- [Jaeger thrift
  exporter](https://opentelemetry-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/exporter/jaeger/jaeger.html)
  configured to send spans to a locally running [SignalFx Smart
  Agent](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/apm/apm-getting-started/apm-smart-agent.html)
  (`http://localhost:9080/v1/trace`).
- Unlimited default limits for [configuration options](#trace-configuration) to
  support full-fidelity traces.

If you're currently using the SignalFx Tracing Library for Python and want to
migrate to the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Python, see [Migrate from
the SignalFx Tracing Library for Python](migration.md).

> :construction: This project is currently in **BETA**.

## Requirements

This Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry requires Python 3.5 or later.
If you're still using Python 2, continue using the SignalFx Tracing Library
for Python.

## Getting Started

The instrumentation works with Python version 3.6+. Supported libraries are
listed
[here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python-contrib/tree/master/instrumentation).

To get started, install the `splunk-opentelemetry` package, run the bootstrap
script and wrap your run command with `splk-py-trace`.

For example, if the runtime parameters were:

```
python main.py --port=8000
```

Then the runtime parameters should be updated to:

```
$ pip install splunk-opentelemetry
$ splk-py-trace-bootstrap
$ SPLUNK_SERVICE_NAME=my-python-app \
    splk-py-trace python main.py --port=8000
```

Notes:
- Depending on the default python version on your system, you might want to use `pip3` and `python3` instead. 
- To be able to run `splk-py-trace` and `splk-py-trace-bootstrap`, the directory pip installs scripts to will
  have to be on your system's PATH environment variable. Generally, this works out of the box when using
  virtual environments, installing packages system-wide or in container images. In some cases, pip may install
  packages into your user local environment. In that case you'll need to add your Python user base's bin directory
  to your system path. You can find out your Python user base as follows by running `python -m site --user-base`.

  For example, if `python -m site --user-base` reports that `/Users/splunk/.local` as the Python user base, then
  you can add the directory to your path on Unix like system as follows:

  ```
  export PATH="/Users/splunk/.local/bin:$PATH"
  ```

The service name is the only configuration option that typically needs to be
specified. A couple other configuration options that may need to be changed or
set are:

- Endpoint if not sending to a locally running Smart Agent with default
  configuration
- Environment attribute (example:
  `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=environment=production`) to specify what
  environment the span originated from.

Instrumentation works by patching supported libraries at runtime with an
OpenTelemetry-compatible tracer to capture and export trace spans. The agent
also registers an OpenTelemetry `get_tracer` so you can support existing custom
instrumentation or add custom instrumentation to your application later.

To see the Python instrumentation in action with sample applications, see our
[examples](https://github.com/signalfx/tracing-examples/tree/master/signalfx-tracing/splunk-otel-python).

## All configuration options

| Environment variable          | Config Option                        | Default value                        | Notes                                                                  |

## Advanced Getting Started

### Alternative: List requirements instead of installing them

The `splk-py-trace-bootstrap` command can optionally print out the list of
packages it would install if you chose. In order to do so, pass
`-a=requirements` CLI argument to it. For example,

```
splk-py-trace-bootstrap -a requirements
```

Will output something like the following:

```
opentelemetry-instrumentation-falcon>=0.15b0
opentelemetry-instrumentation-jinja2>=0.15b0
opentelemetry-instrumentation-requests>=0.15b0
opentelemetry-instrumentation-sqlite3>=0.15b0
opentelemetry-exporter-jaeger>=0.15b0
```

You can pipe the output of this command to append the new packages to your
requirements.txt file or to something like `poetry add`.

### Alternative: Instrument and configure by adding code

If you cannot use `splk-py-trace` command, you can also add a couple of lines
of code to your Python application to achieve the same result.

```python
from splunk_otel.tracing import start_tracing

start_tracing()

# also accepts config options
# start_tracing(endpoint='http://localhost:9080/v1/trace, service_name='unnamed-python-service')

# rest of your python application's entrypoint script
```

## Exporting to Smart Agent, Otel collector or SignalFx ingest

This package exports spans in Jaeger Thrift format over HTTP and supports
exporting to the SignalFx Smart Agent, OpenTelemetry collector and directly to
SignalFx ingest API. You can use `OTEL_EXPORTER_JAEGER_ENDPOINT` environment variable
to specify an export endpoint. The value must be a full URL including scheme and
path.

### Smart Agent

This is the default option. You do not need to set any config options if you
want to export to the Smart Agent and you are running the agent on the default
port (`9080`). The exporter will default to `http://localhost:9080/v1/trace`
when the environment variable is not specified.

### OpenTelemetry Collector

In order to do this, you'll need to enable Jaeger Thrift HTTP receiver on
OpenTelemetry Collector and set `OTEL_EXPORTER_JAEGER_ENDPOINT` to
`http://localhost:14268/api/traces` assuming the collector is reachable via
localhost.

### SignalFx Ingest API

In order to send traces directly to SignalFx ingest API, you need to:

1. Set `OTEL_EXPORTER_JAEGER_ENDPOINT` to
   `https://ingest.<realm>.signalfx.com/v2/trace` where `realm` is your
   SignalFx realm e.g, `https://ingest.us0.signalfx.com/v2/trace`.
2. Set `SPLUNK_ACCESS_TOKEN` to one of your SignalFx APM access tokens.


### Special Cases

#### Celery

Tracing Celery workers works out of the box when you use the `splk-py-trace`
command to start your Python application. However, if you are instrumenting
your celery workers with code, you'll need to make sure you setup tracing for
each worker by using Celery's `celery.signalfx.worker_process_init` signal.

For example:

```python
from splunk_otel.tracing import start_tracing
from celery.signals import worker_process_init

@worker_process_init.connect(weak=False)
def on_worker_process_init(*args, **kwargs):
    start_tracing()

# rest of your python application's entrypoint script
```

#### Django

Automatically instrumenting Django requires `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`
environment variable to be set. The value should be the same as set in your
`manage.py` or `wsgi.py` modules. For example, if your manage.py file sets this
environment variable to `mydjangoproject.settings` and you start your Django
project as `./manage.py runserver`, then you can automatically instrument your
Django project as follows:

```
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=mydjangoproject.settings
splk-py-trace ./manage.py runserver
```

#### Gunicorn

Like Celery, we'll also need to setup tracing per Gunicorn worker. This can be
done by setting up tracing inside Gunicorn's `post_fork()` handler.

For example:

```python
# gunicorn.config.py
from splunk_otel.tracing import start_tracing

def post_fork(server, worker):
    start_tracing()
```

Then add `-c gunicorn.config.py` CLI flag to your gunicorn command.

#### UWSGI 

When using UWSGI, tracing must be setup as a response to the `post_fork` signal. 

For example:

```python
import uwsgidecorators
from splunk_otel.tracing import start_tracing

@uwsgidecorators.postfork
def setup_tracing():
    start_tracing()

```

##### Running with uwsgi
```
uwsgi --http :9090 --wsgi-file <your_app.py> --callable <your_wsgi_callable> --master --enable-threads
```

The above snippet should be placed in the main python script that uwsgi imports and loads.

#### UWSGI and Flask

Using USWGI with Flask requires one additional little step. Calling `start_tracing()` does not auto-instrument pre-existing flask app instances but only flask instances created after. When running flask with uwsgi, we need to create a new flask app instance before the post_fork signal is emitted. This means your flask app will not be auto-instrumented. However, you can still auto-instrument an existing flask app explicitly by importing and calling the flask instrumentor. 

For example:
```python
# app.py
import uwsgidecorators
from splunk_otel.tracing import start_tracing
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.flask import FlaskInstrumentor
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@uwsgidecorators.postfork
def setup_tracing():
    start_tracing()
    # instrument our flask app instance eplicitly
    FlaskInstrumentor().instrument_app(app)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```

##### Running with uWSGI:
```
uwsgi --http :9090 --wsgi-file app.py --callable app --master --enable-threads
```


## Manually instrument an application

Documentation on how to manually instrument a Python application is available
[here](https://opentelemetry-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting-started.html).

## Troubleshooting

Enable debug logging like you would for any Python application.

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

> :warning: Debug logging is extremely verbose and resource intensive. Enable
> debug logging only when needed and disable when done.
